The Shoe purchasing website works as
1. one has to sign in before purchasing items from the servie page
2. When signing in, since I haven't used any databases, a valid format for the email and any length of password is accepted.
3. After signing in, the page doesn't take to services page by itself, so the right upper button Buy is used for that purpose.
4. After clicking the purchase button on service page, if signed in, it will direct to buy.html
5. After checking out at buy.html, the cancel button is used to get back to service page.
Since I hadn't used any TimeOut methods, I kept on getting "Unchecked runtime.lastError: The message port closed before a response was received", and that's why the login and buy page do not direct to other pages, since it all happens will a very small elapsed time.
